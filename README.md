   Description
   
   our Flutter application for the home rental system allows tenants to create a profile and post their available rental properties. They can upload pictures, add descriptions, specify rental rates, and provide their contact information for interested subtenants to reach out to them.
   
On the other hand, subtenants can create their own profile and browse through the available rental properties. They can use search filters to narrow down their options based on factors such as location, price, and size. Once they find a property that suits their needs, they can contact the tenant directly through the provided contact information and arrange a viewing or any other necessary details.

The application will not handle payment transactions, but it will connect the tenant and subtenant by providing contact information. Essentially, the application acts as a mediator between tenants and subtenants, facilitating the rental process but leaving the actual rental transaction to be handled outside of the application.

The application will also include a review system that allows tenants to express what they think about the house. This feature can be particularly useful for other subtenants.

To ensure that the application is secure, we will implement authentication mechanisms such as username and password login. we will also include features such as rating and review systems, where users can rate their experience with subtenants.

As for the user interface, our Flutter application will be designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. It will have a clean and modern layout that allows users to easily navigate through the various features. we will use appealing colors, icons, and graphics to make the application visually appealing and engaging for users.

Overall, our Flutter application for the home rental system will serves as a convenient and efficient platform for tenants and subtenants to connect and facilitate the rental process.
